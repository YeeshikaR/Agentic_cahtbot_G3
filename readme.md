# 🤖 Mock Agentic Chatbot Demo

Welcome to the **Mock Agentic Chatbot Demo** – a fun and interactive app that shows how an AI system can break down complex tasks and assign them to different specialized agents (like a mini team of bots 🛠️). This is a mock implementation inspired by the LangChain agent architecture, built using **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 What It Does

This app takes a complex query like:

> “Organize a robotics workshop”

And automatically:
- Breaks it into smaller subtasks.
- Assigns each subtask to the best-suited agent.
- Executes each subtask with mock results.
- Shows you a clear progress report.

You’ll see agents like:
- 🔍 **Research Agent** – for gathering info.
- 📋 **Logistics Agent** – for booking and setup.
- 📧 **Communication Agent** – for emails & messaging.
- 🎨 **Design Agent** – for visuals and materials.
- 📅 **Planning Agent** – for schedules and structure.
- 💰 **Finance Agent** – for cost and budget estimation.
