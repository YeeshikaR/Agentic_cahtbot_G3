 ü§ñ Agentic Chatbot Demo

This project is a **mock agentic chatbot demo** that takes a single user query (e.g.,  
_"Organize a robotics workshop"_) and automatically **breaks it down into subtasks** such as:

- Book venue  
- Email coordinator  
- Prepare poster  

Each subtask is then "handled" by a **mock agent** (no real external APIs), and the chatbot displays a **progress log** of how the query is executed step by step.  

‚ú® This project is for demonstration purposes only ‚Äî it mimics the flow of agentic task execution, but does not actually send emails or book venues.
